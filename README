This is a sample stack for ANEML (Angular, Node.js, Express, and MarkLogic) pronounced "animal"

The framework was constructed using this website as a guide: 
http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html

There are two components:
1.  Node.js Server.  This code is in ./myapp/server.js
	To start the server type: "node server.js"
	It will now be listening at: 3000 
	Port is specified in server.js

2.  Angular JS Client.  This code is in ./index.html and ./script.js

3.  Install MarkLogic Node.js development client
	sudo npm install marklogic
	*See detailed instructions in the ML node-dev.pdf Developers Documentation

TO RUN THE DEMO:
1. Run the server node ./myapp/server.js

2. Open Index.html in a browser window
